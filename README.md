# Project Documentation

•	Browser Developer Tools – Used for testing responsiveness and debugging UI issues.

•	Material UI – Used  for responsive design and component styling, including useTheme, useMediaQuery, Dialog, Box, and Paper.

•	Added inline comments within the code to improve readability and understanding.

•	I've added a cool, moving color effect to the sidebar's background. This is done using a gradient that smoothly shifts colors over time, making the sidebar look more dynamic and visually interesting.

•	The sidebar now slides into view when it appears on the screen. This sliding effect makes the sidebar's entrance and exit smoother and more engaging, enhancing the overall user experience.

•	When we hover over the Topbar, it comes  with a colorful gradient animation

•	The page is fully responsive
